# Hugo Relearn Theme

The [Relearn theme](http://github.com/McShelby/hugo-theme-relearn) is a theme for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static website generator written in Go. Where Hugo is often used for blogs, this theme is designed with documentation in mind.

{{% notice info %}}
The theme is a fork of the great [Learn theme](https://github.com/matcornic/hugo-theme-learn) with the aim of fixing long outstanding bugs and adepting to latest Hugo features. As far as possible this theme tries to be a drop-in replacement for the Learn theme.
